Title: Differentiating voices of men and birds
Version: 0.1.0
Authors: Eva V. Zadorozny, Benjamin Panny, Michelle Sun
Maintainer: <evaz@pitt.edu>
Description: This package processes, visualizes and analyzes sound waves initially 
saved in wav files. First it draws a spectrogram and converts each wav to a numeric 
thumbprint. Then it fuzes the thumbprints into an analysis data model. This data
set is visualized using color-coded clusters of birds and men in amplitude planes of
choice. Afterwards, Support Vector Machine is trained using this ADaM data set. Finally, 
we ask questions about individual thumbprints, old and new (even Eva and a toy loon) to
see what the algorithm would predict - is this a bird or a man?
